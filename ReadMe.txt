I have implemented the solution considering the given scenarios in the problem statement. I have previous exposure into RedHat Openshift.   

1. We can have the pipleline.yamls configured for CI for the Gitops. 
2. We can have the ArgoCD used for the CD  to deploy into cloud infrastucture. 
3. The logging could be done using serilog with logs available in Kibana.
